            It is a solo project, so I did discover some of my weakness and strengths as I have been doing this project. My streangth is I can style well using frontend libraries and I can make any site responsive with less effort preplaned. My weakness is I tend to spend too much time on frontend styling. <br /> <br />
            Only conflict I had with my self to keep up good time with busy week schedule and illness. I planned to fininsh this project in 1 week, But I fell ill with tonsilities and fever. So struggle to start the project as planned. <br /> <br />
            I had difficulties to understand the project because there is no UX design and no example of what to created. And the Pdf file that I have been given by CYF is for group mini project not solo. I called Cyf's regional mangager (Mariana) to understand what is expected from me. But she kept repeating that all instructions are in this pdf file. That made me even more confused because firstly its a group mini project brifing and secondly there is no UX design that I could follow.
            So I used my initiative and creativity to make an example website version of that pdf brief. I have applied some react libraries to make it nicer which is good practice for my technical side as I didn't use them before.
